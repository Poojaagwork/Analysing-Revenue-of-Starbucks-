The Objective of the project: Increase the revenue of Starbucks. This research will examine the impact of potential explanatory variables which can help increase in quarterly revenue of Starbucks. 

Metric to track objective: The variable “revenue” will be used as the dependent variable.

Success criteria: To show how Starbucks will achieve net revenue by 10%

Regression and Time Series Analysis: We will apply a regression analysis model to test the relationship between potential explanatory variables driving the Revenue for Starbucks. Potential explanatory variables will be perceived as statistically valid if they explain behavior at the 95% confidence level. 

Time series analysis will be performed to identify the trend in Revenue for both Starbucks and Dunkin. Using the result we can forecast from the linear regression model how revenue growth looks like for the next 5 years and if it meets our objective.
